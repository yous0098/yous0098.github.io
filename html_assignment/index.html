                <h2>About me!</h2>
                <p>I am enrolled in <abbr title="interactive media design"> IMD </abbr> and this is my first time working with <em>Git hub</em>.I would like to acknowledge you for giving me such an incredible opportunity to express my ever-imagined future. Living in "Paradise on earth" has allowed me to experience majestic nature and flawless beauty. My homeland, Kashmir (India), is a delightful place filled with memories of my life and experiences.<br> The importance of education was instilled in me by my mother. Her motivation, positive approach, and commitment towards life became my moral foundations. 
                    My quest for knowledge begins in my school days and it was during my graduation my motive and purpose in life became apparent. After my Graduation from the University of Kashmir in 2016, I was able to position myself in one of the renowned organizations-Secure Software Solutions as a junior Web Designer, which unexpectedly ended due to the political situation of the state. In 2019, I moved to UAE and started working with an IT- firm, wherein I gained personal and professional experience.<br> Living without family for the first time and pursuing my dream job was altogether challenging and exciting. It was there I felt the absence of competencies in many industry-related skills. I would attribute this to two factors. First is the lack of program quality assurance of educational institutions of my territory and more importantly, lack of exposure to quality work standards that are well established in Western work environments.
                    I am excited to be a part of the program where I can explore.I am amazed how photography is embeded with programming and digital graphics.I joined the program in May 10<sup>th</sup> and on the first day got a chance to see all the faculity members and students.</p>
