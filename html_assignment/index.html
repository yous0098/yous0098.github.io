                <img src="images/ty.jpg" alt="T.yousuf" id="my-image">
                <p>I am enrolled in <abbr title="interactive media design"> IMD </abbr> and this is my first time working with <em>Git hub</em>.
                    I am excited to be a part of the program where I can explore. 
                    I am amazed how photography is impeded with programming and digital graphics.
                    I joined the program in May 10<sup>th</sup> and on the first day got a chance to see all the faculty members and students. </p>
                    <p>My name is Tyba Yousuf. I am a native of India and have completed a bachelors's degree in Computer Science in 2016. 
                    For the last 3 years, I was working as a front-end developer in a renowned organization called Secure Software Solutions in India. 
                    One of the things about the program that piqued my curiosity is the opportunity to don many hats.
                    Currently, I am in Level 1 and attending lectures from home, which is something that I never thought of.I am a keen learner, ready to grasp new things. 
                    I get easily bored while reading books and newspapers.</p>
